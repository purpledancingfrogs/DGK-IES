# DGK-IES Invariants Catalog

This document defines the non-negotiable invariants enforced by the DGK-IES system.  
An invariant is a property of the system that **must remain true across all states, transitions, and failures**.

Violation of any invariant constitutes a system fault.

## I-001: Non-Erasure of State

**Statement**  
Information introduced into the system may not be destroyed. It may only be transformed, fragmented, or constrained.

**Rationale**  
True erasure creates unverifiable blind spots and enables adversarial state manipulation.

**Failure Mode**  
Silent data deletion, truncation, or overwrite without trace.

**Enforcement Layer**  
Invariant Proof Engine  
Kernel Enforcement  
Audit Log Hash Chain

## I-002: Deterministic Replayability

**Statement**  
Given identical inputs and initial conditions, the system must produce identical outputs.

**Rationale**  
Non-determinism prevents verification and enables ambiguity laundering.

**Failure Mode**  
Time-dependent behavior, entropy injection, or hidden randomness.

Reference Engine  
Checksums  
Reproducibility Protocol

## I-003: Constraint Visibility

**Statement**  
All constraints acting on information must be observable and enumerable.

**Rationale**  
Invisible constraints function as covert control channels.

**Failure Mode**  
Implicit limits, undocumented filters, or opaque policy enforcement.

API Contract  
Threat Model Mapping

## I-004: Violation Detectability

**Statement**  
Invariant violations must be detectable at or before the point of failure.

**Rationale**  
Undetected violation equals total system compromise.

**Failure Mode**  
Delayed alerts, post-hoc discovery, or unverifiable error states.

**Enforcement Layer**  
Invariant Schema Validation  
Runtime Assertions  
CI Verification

## I-005: Audit Chain Integrity

**Statement**  
All system actions must be cryptographically linked in a tamper-evident chain.

**Rationale**  
Audit trails without integrity guarantees are narrative artifacts, not evidence.

**Failure Mode**  
Log rewriting, truncation, or hash discontinuity.

**Enforcement Layer**  
Checksum Engine  
Signed Attestations  
Verification Artifacts

---

## I-006: Enforcement Hierarchy Consistency

**Statement**  
Higher enforcement layers may constrain lower layers, never the reverse.

**Rationale**  
Reversal enables privilege escalation and policy bypass.

**Failure Mode**  
User-space override of kernel enforcement or proof layer.

**Enforcement Layer**  
Kernel Enforcement  
Secure Boot Chain

## I-007: Explicit Failure

**Statement**  
All failures must halt or degrade explicitly, never silently.

**Rationale**  
Silent failure is indistinguishable from adversarial success.

**Failure Mode**  
Dropped errors, ignored exceptions, or masked faults.
