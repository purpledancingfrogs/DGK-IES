# DGK-IES
**Deterministic Governance Kernel — Information Entropy System**

Information does not vanish.  
It fragments, reflects, and persists under constraint.

DGK-IES is a deterministic, auditable system for modeling how information behaves under pressure: fragmentation, boundary enforcement, degradation, and paradox preservation. It treats intelligence failures and contradictions as *physical-style systems with invariants*, not bugs to be smoothed away.

## Core Principles
- **Determinism first** — reproducible outputs, no hidden stochasticity
- **Auditability** — every transformation traceable
- **Constraint realism** — limits are modeled, not ignored
- **Paradox preservation** — contradictions are surfaced, not collapsed
- **Entropy-aware design** — degradation is a feature to study, not an error

## What This Is
- A kernel for reasoning about intelligence under constraints  
- A sandbox for governance, safety, and degradation mechanics  
- A foundation for higher-order audit and alignment systems  

## What This Is Not
- A probabilistic LLM
- A black-box optimizer
- A narrative or demo-only project

## Status
Early-stage core repository.  
Interfaces, invariants, and primitives are being stabilized.
