# DGK-IES — Formal Specification

This document defines the deterministic invariants, causal bindings, and entropy models enforced by the DGK-IES kernel.

## Invariants
- Determinism
- Auditability
- Paradox preservation
- Pre-execution governance

## Causal Model
All state transitions are time-bound, meaning-bound, and decision-bound.

## Entropy Model
Information redistributes under constraint; it is never destroyed.

## Verification
All behaviors are replayable and externally auditable.
